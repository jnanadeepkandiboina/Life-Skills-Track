- Exercise immediately boosts brain neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline.
- A single workout improves mood, attention span, and reaction time temporarily.
- Long-term exercise changes brain structure, increasing volume of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
- Exercise promotes the growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus enhancing memory.
- Regular aerobic exercise protects the brain from cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.
