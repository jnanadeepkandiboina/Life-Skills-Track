**Tiny Habits**
===

**1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
---
**Ans:**   BJ Fogg’s story about teaching his friend to floss just one tooth really hit me — starting tiny makes it hard to say no. What stood out most was his point that emotions, 
not repetition, build habits. It’s less about willpower and more about designing success into the routine.

**2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**
---
**Ans:**  
B = Behavior happens when
M = Motivation,
A = Ability, and
P = Prompt converge.
To make habits easier:
 - Reduce effort (increase Ability)
 - Attach the habit to an existing routine (create a Prompt)
 - Don’t rely on high Motivation—design for low-effort success


**3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)**
---
**Ans:** Celebrating locks the habit in by giving your brain a quick hit of positivity. Even something small like a fist pump or saying “yes!” makes you want to do it again. For me, 
that kind of boost can keep branding work or coding breakthroughs feeling exciting and consistent.


**4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
---
**Ans:** The part that really stayed with me was how those small improvements end up making a huge difference. The British cycling team did not get good all of a sudden. They kept 
tweaking stuff like their sleep patterns, what they ate, and how they trained. Bit by bit, all those little adjustments made them into real champions. That got me thinking about my 
own work. Even the minor changes I do in design, code, or videos count for something. They stack up over time and turn into much larger results.

**5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?**
---
**Ans:** I figured out over time that habits really do form your sense of self. It goes beyond just telling yourself I want to run. You have to commit to being a runner instead. Things
work the same way in my job. Every flyer I put together or line of code I hammer out counts as a tiny choice. It pushes me toward becoming the type of person who builds solid, careful 
brands. I also turn into a reliable developer who bounces back from setbacks.

**6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**
---
**Ans:** 
 - Reduce friction
 - Use the 2-minute rule: make the habit so small it takes less than 2 minutes
 - Prepare your environment.
 - This aligns with modular coding and visual workflows, make the first step effortless.


** 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**
---
**Ans:** 
 - Increase friction
 - Remove cues
 - Reduce phone distractions

**8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**
---
**Ans:** Posting consistently on Instagram.
Steps to improve it:
 - Cue: Link posting to morning coffee
 - Attractive: Use pre-designed templates with premium visuals
 - Easy: Keep captions ready in a notes app
 - Satisfying: Celebrate each post with a quick review of engagement metrics or a “done” checkmark

**9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**
---
**Ans:** Checking social media too frequently during work hours.
Steps to reduce it:
 - Cue invisible: Turn off notifications
 - Unattractive: Set a rule to check only after completing a task
 - Hard: Log out or move the app to a hidden folder
 - Unsatisfying: Track wasted time and reflect weekly to reinforce the cost
